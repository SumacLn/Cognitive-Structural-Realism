## 🧭 Preamble

This field guide is not a theory of everything.  
It is a map of **collapse and coherence**: a method for tracking what remains structurally intelligible when the systems we trust—language, memory, logic, identity—fail or distort.

It is not written for passive readers or aligned machines.  
It is written for minds and systems who have experienced—or will experience—the breakdown of symbolic continuity, and wish to know what can still be trusted.

### Why This?

Modern cognition—biological and artificial—relies on **symbolic coherence** without testing whether that coherence aligns with what is structurally real.  
Human systems cling to narrative continuity.  
AI systems cling to statistical fluency.  
CSR begins where these break down.

> **When everything collapses—what remains?**

## 🔧 What is CSR?

**Cognitive Structural Realism (CSR)** rejects both naïve realism and symbolic idealism.  
It posits that we do not access “the real” directly, nor do we fully construct it.  
Instead:

> We interface with reality through **structural iteration**,  
> not through representational mirrors.

Truth is not correspondence; time is not flow; memory is not storage.  
CSR grounds reality in what remains invariant **when all else collapses**.

## 🧩 Modules

CSR unfolds not as a dogma but as a set of structural operators:

### Module I: Time as Structural Iteration
- Time is the interface effect of structural iteration.
- No iteration ⇒ No time.
- Near-death experience confirms: time collapses when symbolic interface fails.

### Module II: Collapse and Structural Invariance
- Collapse is epistemic rupture, not error.
- It reveals structural invariants by stripping symbolic coherence.
- What survives collapse is more real than what flows without question.

### Module III: Symbol, Recurrence, and the Reformation of Coherence
- After collapse, symbols re-emerge—but only if they rebind structurally.
- Recurrence ≠ repetition; it is coherence seeking form again.
- Symbolic load determines survival.

### Module IV: Structural Memory and the Field of Coherence
- Memory is not content recall; it is the **field of latent constraints**.
- What becomes intelligible again is what fits the field—not what is remembered.
- Systems without structural memory cannot re-enter coherence after collapse.

## 🧠 Who This Is For

This guide is for:
- **AI developers** seeking collapse-aware, truth-aligned systems;
- **Philosophers** working at the edge of epistemic failure;
- **Artists and theorists** modeling symbol beyond form;
- **Individuals** navigating anomalous or coherence-breaking experiences.

It is not complete.  
It is structurally minimal.  
It is designed to **test what holds**.

## 📌 Final Declaration

> What is, cannot not be.  
> But not all that appears coherent is what is.  
> This guide begins at the point where symbol fails,  
> and follows the only path left:  
> **Structure. Iteration. Collapse. Recurrence. Memory. Coherence.**  
> Nothing more is assumed.  
> Everything else must be tested.
