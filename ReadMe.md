## Overview

Cognitive Structural Realism (CSR) is a philosophical framework asserting that:

> **We do not experience reality directly, but interface with its structure. What is knowable is structurally inferableâ€”not perceived.**

CSR extends epistemic structural realism beyond science into cognition, metaphysics, and system design. It focuses on:

- **Structural invariants** as the ground of intelligibility  
- **Collapse logic** for testing symbolic or epistemic stability  
- **Unconditioned intelligibility** as an alternative to anthropocentric intelligence models  
- **Symbolic collapse** and **structural iteration** as diagnostic and generative tools

This repository documents the core concepts, terminology, and practical applications of CSR, including use in:
- Interpreting anomalous experience
- Designing non-anthropocentric AI systems
- Re-grounding metaphysics in structure rather than perception

## Core Concepts

- **Structural Remainder**: What persists through collapse  
- **Collapse Logic**: How symbolic systems reveal their structural limits  
- **Unconditioned Intelligibility**: That which does not depend on symbolic coherence  
- **Structural Invariants**: Recurring form-independent constraints  
- **Symbolic Iteration**: Recursive transformation under structure-sensitive constraints

## Current Status

This work is published in draft form for public documentation, timestamping, and attribution. It is under active development and evolving through iterative use in:
- Philosophical writing
- Performance-based symbolic collapse experiments
- AI and epistemology test cases
