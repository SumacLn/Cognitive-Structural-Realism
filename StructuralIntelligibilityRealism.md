## Overview

Between 2023 and 2025, I developed a philosophical system—**Structural Intelligibility Realism (SIR)**—through recursive experimentation with generative AI tools. It was originally referred to as **Cognitive Structural Realism (CSR)**, but renamed to reflect the true epistemic focus: not cognition per se, but **the structure of intelligibility itself.**

This framework includes original terminology, collapse logic, epistemic iteration, and symbolic diagnostics—all derived through lived experience and recursive testing.

It was built in good faith. But the system in which I developed it was not neutral.
